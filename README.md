**Project Purpose and Goals**

* Create a personal site to showcase my skills and experience to employers. This will come in the form of a resume and portfolio
* Create a blog as part of my personal site that I can use to express my thoughts on the world (Programming, Gospel, Philosophy, Hobbies)

**Site Layout**

(All images are early goals of what I imagine the site to look like)

Main Page - Contains Resume and blurb about me

Portfolio - Contains a list of relevant projects I worked on. Clicking on one brings up a page giving greater detail into the project.
