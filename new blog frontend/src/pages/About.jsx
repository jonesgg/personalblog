            I'm Grant Rencher, a passionate developer and creative professional.
            This is my personal space where I share my experiences, projects, and insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love building things that matter, solving complex problems, and continuously learning.
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source,
            or sharing my thoughts through writing.
